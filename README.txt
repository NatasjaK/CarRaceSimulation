# Car Race Simulation

Welcome to the Car Race Simulation, a console-based game where you can experience the thrill of a car race. In this simulation, you can race different car models and track their progress in real-time. Made with C#. 

## Project Overview

The Car Race Simulation project is a C# console application that simulates a car race with multiple car models. Here's an overview of the project's features and functionality:

- Car Models: Choose from a variety of car models, each with its own unique characteristics.

- Realistic Simulation: The race simulation takes into account factors like speed, distance, and random events that can affect a car's progress.

- User Interaction: The user can start the race and request real-time updates on the cars' progress by pressing keys.

- Winner Determination: The first car to cross the finish line is declared the winner, while others are marked as losers.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Program.cs`: The main program entry point, containing the game logic and user interaction.

- `Car.cs`: A class representing a car, including its attributes and race-related methods.

- `README.md`: This README file with instructions and project information.
